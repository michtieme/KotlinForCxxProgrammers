# Kotlin for C++ programmers

The following guide is intended for programmers looking to learn the Kotlin language, but coming from an experienced C++ background.  The guide can also be used by Kotlin programmers looking to gain a better understanding of C++ fundamentals.

# Language overview

## Kotlin

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically-typed, general purpose programming language. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Kotlin is developed by JetBrains, and the [Kotlin foundation](https://kotlinfoundation.org/) promotes and advances the development of the language.

High level motivation for developing with Kotlin on Android:

1) Supported by Google as a first class development language on Android since 2019
2) Language encourages concise code, with emphasis on reducing boiler plate
3) Mature language and environment
4) Kotlin support in Android Jetpack and other libraries
5) Interoperability with Java
6) Support for multi-platform development
7) Code safety 
8) Large learning base 
9) Big development community

For a deeper dive into the Kotlin language, see the [language documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html).

## C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It was initially conceived as 'C with classes'. The language has extended significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic and functional features. C++ became popular in systems programming and embedded environments were resources were  constrained.  High performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use were key design highlights.

C++ is standardised by the ISO with new revisions of the standard aiming to achieve a 3 year release cadence. The current standard is C++20. 

## Qt
Qt is a cross platform widget framework primarily aimed at the development of rich graphical user interfaces. Qt is pronounced 'cute') or it's initials "QT".

The killer features of Qt are:
1) Cross platform widget toolkit for C++
2) Signals and Slots. A language construct allowing decoupled communication between objects
   through the observer pattern
3) Metaobject compiler (moc) - an interpretation of macros within annotated C++ code
   to generate additional C++ code to extend the C++ language
4) QML a declarative UI specification language for laying out graphical components
